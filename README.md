# airPy
The airPy package was developed to extract high-resolution satellite data from Google Earth Engine and calculate Machine Learning-ready features for air pollution studies.

The code in this repository performs the following tasks:

**1. Download satellite data from Google Earth Engine**
  * Per specified latitude, longitude, and AOI buffer extent, data is downloaded from Google Earth Engine. The download job is fully specified by the user-generated configuration file, which includes all details for the data to be downloaded and processed, including: collection type, latitude/longitude points, analysis period, and buffer size.
  * Data can be saved as an xarray format covering the user-specified AOI extent, or as individual images per latitude, longitude point given.

**2. Generate Machine Learning-ready features**
* Per latitude, longitude point of interest over the user-specified AOI, relevant statistical features are calculated for the following collections: [MODIS Land cover Yearly Product](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD12Q1#citations), [MODIS Fire_cci Burned Area Pixel Product](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_CCI_FireCCI_5_1#description), [Gridded Population of the World Version 4.11)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CIESIN_GPWv411_GPW_Population_Density), and [VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites Version 1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_VIIRS_DNB_MONTHLY_V1_VCMCFG).
    * Features are calculated based on the temporal cadence specified.
    * Where data is unavailable due to lack of satellite coverage, data is set to NaN or filled with specified fill value to avoid calculation errors.

### `airPy` feature extraction
The diagram below depicts an example of the extraction process over the extent of Australia, matching the 11.1x11.1km spatial resolution of the MOMO-Chem (Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data assimilation) model output. Per latitude, longitude point on the MOMO-Chem grid:
* Query the GEE dataset of interest
* Create a ~55.5km radius buffer around the point of interest
* Extract the data over the buffer AOI
* Process features of interest (i.e. maximum population per grid point from World Population dataset, percent of each land cover class from MODIS dataset, etc.)

To use the Google Earth Engine API, you must create and authenticate a Google Earth Engine account. Information on the Earth Engine Python API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/intro-to-python-api). 

## Creating ML-ready features from GEE data with ``airPy``
#### Running the airPy pipeline
The airPy pipeline job is fully specified by a configration dictionary generated by the `GenerateConfig` class. To create a new configuration and run the pipeline use the command
```
python run_airpy.py
```
and specify the various parameters of the data of interest. The available configurable parameters are:
* `--gee_data`: The name of the GEE dataset of interest, either modis, pop, fire, or nightlight.
    *    modis: MCD12Q1.061 MODIS Land Cover Type Yearly Global 500m, available 2001-01-01 to 2021-01-01
    *    pop: GPWv411: Population Density (Gridded Population of the World Version 4.11), available 2000-01-01 to 2020-01-01
    *    fire: FireCCI51: MODIS Fire_cci Burned Area Pixel Product, Version 5.1, available 2001-01-01 to 2020-12-01
    *    nightlight: VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites Version 1, available 2012-04-01 to 2023-01-01
* `--region`: Boundary region on Earth to extract data in (latitudes), (longitudes). Must be one of:
    *   `globe`: (-90, 90),(-180, 180)
    *   `europe` (35, 65),(-10, 25)
    *   `asia`: (20, 50),(100, 145)
    *   `australia`: (-50, -10),(130, 170)
    *   `north_america`: (20, 55),(-125, -70)
    *   `west_europe`: (25, 80),(-20, 10)
    *   `east_europe`: (25, 80),(10, 40)
    *   `west_north_america`: (10, 80),(-140, -95)
    *   `east_north_america`: (10, 80), (-95, -50)
    *   `toar2`: Locations of TOAR2 stations based on TOAR2 metadata
* `--date`: Date of query. Must be in format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
* `--analysis_type`: Type of analysis for data extraction. Must be one of collection, images.
* `--add_time`: Specify if time component should be added to collection xarray. Useful for integrating into time series ML datasets. One of 'y' or 'n'.
* `--buffer_size`: Specify region of interest (ROI) buffer extent. Units in metres.
* `--config-dir`: Specify the output directory for the config file.
* `--save_dir`: Specify run rave directory.
Example:
```
python run_airpy.py --gee_data fire --region australia --date 2020-01-01 --analysis_type collection --buffer_size 55500 --configs_dir /configs --save_dir /runs
```
Generates a config file named `config_australia_fire_2020-01-01_buffersize_55500_collection.json` and kicks of the airpy job.
To look at the help file for more information on paramaters, run the command ```python run_airpy.py --help```.

## Testing
Tests for each script are stored in the `airpy/tests` folder. `pytest` is used to test scripts in the `airpy` folder via the following command:
```
python3 -m pytest
```
